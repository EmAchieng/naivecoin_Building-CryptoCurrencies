# naivecoin_Building-CryptoCurrencies

I am implementing a toy version of blockchain with naivecoin using Typescript covering the following:
* A defined block and blockchain structure
* Methods to add new blocks to the blockchain with arbitrary data
* Blockchain nodes that communicate and sync the blockchain with other nodes
* A simple HTTP API to control the node
